=head1 Description

This class provides a hash of Pause IDs/names of Acme::CPANAuthors::*
authorin' CPAN authors.

I started this module because
L<Acme::CPANAuthors::UnitedStates|Acme::CPANAuthors::UnitedStates> doesn't
exist and apparently I'm not listed in
L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Japanese|Acme::CPANAuthors::Japanese>. ((sigh)) I just
want to be a part of something... great... greater... than-- um, sorry, lost
my train of thought.

Anyway, I decided both L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Earth|Acme::CPANAuthors::Earth>
(well covered between http://search.cpan.org/author/ and
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=who_is) and
L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Authors|Acme::CPANAuthors::Authors> (only include authors
who have published at least one distribution, script, etc.) would just be too
time consuming for a 3AM lapse in judgement so... there you are.

=head1 Installation

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

=head1 Maintenance

Have you authored a module in the C<Acme::CPANAuthors> namespace, aren't
listed here, and would like to be? Or are you currently listed but have since
turned away from your deviant, C<Acme> ways and would like to be removed? Just
contact me L<via email|/"AUTHOR"> or stop by the Issue Tracker and I'll fix ya
right up.

=head1 Bugs

Report any bugs or feature requests to the Issue tracker or
directly to L<me via email|/"AUTHOR">. I'll keep you up to date on any related
changes.

Seriously, it's just a list of names... what could possibly go wrong?

E<lt>_E<lt>

E<gt>_E<gt>

Yeah.
